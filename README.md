# Early Heart Attack Prediction - Code Implementation
This repository contains the code implementation for the research paper: "EARLY HEART ATTACK PREDICTION BY USING MACHINE LEARNING" by Sarang Ali, Abuzar Shahid, and Gohar Mumtaz.

The project focuses on leveraging machine learning models, specifically the LightGBM classifier, to predict the early threat of heart attacks.

# ðŸ“– Abstract of the Research
Machine learning is increasingly applied across various domains, significantly advancing fields like digital healthcare. This research leverages machine learning models to predict the early threat of heart attacks, aiming to support healthcare systems and enhance human well-being. Heart attacks are a significant cause of mortality, often remaining undetected until a critical event occurs, which underscores the need for early and accurate risk assessment. This study focuses on identifying individuals at high risk of cardiac events with high accuracy, intending to alert users to consult with medical professionals promptly. The study utilizes a publicly available "Heart Attack Prediction" dataset.  The data was split into 90% for training and 10% for testing. Python's Optuna library was employed for hyperparameter tuning to identify the best machine learning model and its parameters.  The LightGBM classifier was found to be the most effective for this binary classification task, demonstrating promising results on the test data.

### ðŸ”‘ Keywords
Machine learning, LightGBM classifier, Parameter tuning

#### ðŸš€ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical implementation of the heart attack prediction model described in the paper. This includes data preprocessing, feature engineering (as implied by the dataset description in the paper ), model training with hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, and evaluation of the LightGBM classifier

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (the paper implies Python usage ). The following Python libraries are essential, as suggested by the paper's methodology: Â  

- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)
- scikit-learn (for general machine learning tasks and metrics)
- LightGBM (the chosen classifier ) Â  
- Optuna (for hyperparameter tuning ) Â  
- imbalanced-learn
